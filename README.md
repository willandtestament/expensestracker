hello all. this is my python expenses tracker

it does what it needs to do but could definitely be improved! right now there isn't much in the way of input checks, meaning if someone types a sentence it could probably break the whole code ðŸ˜…but assuming you dont dick around with it then it should work ok smile

best,

will
